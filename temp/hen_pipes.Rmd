# Goal 

- easier to read & understand code


```{r}
# if you load any package of the tidyverse, the pipe operator becomes 
# available. To load it specifically, load the package magrittr.
library(tidyverse)

# lets say we want to compute the log of the squareroot of x and 
# then round x. 
x<- c(2, 4, 10, 3, 5, 20, 6)

# you can write either
x_log_sqrt_rn1 <- round(log(sqrt(x)), 2)

# or you can write
x_sqrt <- sqrt(x)
x_log_sqrt <- log(x_sqrt)
x_log_sqrt_rn2 <- round(x_log_sqrt, 2)
x_log_sqrt_rn2


# or using the pipe you can write 
x_log_sqrt_rn3 <- x %>% sqrt() %>%
  log() %>%
  round(2)
```
