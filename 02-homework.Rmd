**Session 1: Before you learn the language** 

Create an rProject using Rstudio incl. a folder for your R code and your data.

 


**Session 2: Introduction to R**  

1. Take a look at the [Tidyverse coding style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/files.html).
2. Download the [script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HenrikEckermann/donders_r/master/donders_course/R/basics.R) and try to understand the content.
3. Then, create 3 vectors: A logical, a character and a numeric one that have an equal length of 5.
4. Create a list that contains all the vectors.
5. Take one of the vectors and select:
   - the last element
   - all except the first element
6. Then take the list and select:
   - the first element as a list 
   - the second element of the third element in the list.





**Session 3: Working with dataframes**  

1. Go through the [script](https://github.com/HenrikEckermann/donders_r/raw/master/course_project/R/dataframes_and_import_data.R), read the comments and understand the code.
2. Create a new R file in your project and import your own data in R as a dataframe. 
3. How many rows and columns does your dataframe have?
4. What are the datatypes of the vectors within your dataframe?
5. Create another new R file called dataframes.R. Open it. In R, there is a preloaded dataframe called "mtcars". Using only the methods we learned today, try to perform the following actions:
   - Take a look at the first 10 rows and last 10 rows
   - Create a new dataframe that only retains the columns mpg, disp and hp of cars that have 6 cylinders (cyl is the column for the number of cylinders)
   - if you did not already: answer the same question but use the %>% operator to get to your answer!
   - How many observations are in this new dataframe?
   - export that dataframe to an excel file in your data folder
