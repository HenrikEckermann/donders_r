### Introduction

- replication crisis in biomedical and social sciences
- status quo: p < 0.05
- Daniel Benjamin suggested to lower p value to 0.005 for new discoveries
- Insufficient! Abandon statistical significance, drop the NHST as default paradigm. Note abandon altogether.
- The paper discusses: 
 1. General problems with NHST that motivate why to abandon and that remain when only lowering p threshold
 2. Recommendations for how, in practice, the p-value can be demoted from its threshold screening role and instead be considered as just one among many pieces of evidence in the scientific publication process and statistical decision making broadly.

--- 

### Problems General to NHST 

- null hypothesis strictly assumes that an effect is 0.
- that includes that the systematic error is assumed to be 0.
- - since effects are generally small and variable the 0 effect assumption is false
- think about measurement error, problems with reliability & validity, biased samples, non-random treatment assignment, missingness, non-response, failure of double- blinding, non-compliance and confounding
- even if correct, the effect would not be zero because measurements are generally noisy and systemically so.
- a decision rule of p < 0.005 would aggravate this problem:
  - noisy estimates attain significance upwardly biased in magnitude and often in the wrong sign; many smaller, less reource-intensive, noisier studies would be more likely to yield one or more statistically significant results than fewer larger more resource-intensive, better studies

--- 


### Categorization of Evidence 

- statistically significant vs not statistically significant
- sometimes "marginally significant"
- the p-value is arbitrary
- categorization has no ontological basis
- improvement, BUT 1. p value is most often defined relative to the generally implausible and uninteresting sharp null hypothesis and 2. poor measure of the evidence for or against a statistical hypothesis 


Note:  
Specifically, Rosnow and Rosenthal (1989) note that “from an ontological viewpoint, there is no sharp line between a ‘significant’ and a ‘nonsignificant’ difference; significance in statistics...varies continuously between extremes” and thus advocate “view[ing] the strength of evidence for or against the null as a fairly continuous function of the magnitude of p.”



---

### Erroneous Scientific Reasoning  

- logical fallacy: Rejecting the Null hypothesis is often interpreted as positive or even definitive evidence in favor of some preferred alternative hypothesis
- arbitrary treshhold vs more holistic viewpoint
- statistical significance vs practical importance
- causal vs correlational 
- NHST encourages researcher to engage in dichotomous thinking rather than interpreting evidence continuously (demonstration of a difference vs no difference based on arbitrary p value).
- 

---

### Misinterpretation of the p-value 

- E.G.:
  - the probability that H0 is true 
  - 1 - P(H1) 
  - 1 - probability of replication
  - study of interpretation mistakes 

---

### Problems specific to the Bejamin et al proposal 


---  

### Summation and recommendations 
- statistics is hard, especially when effects are small and variable and measurements are noisy
- there is no quick fix 
- critical first step is to accept uncertainty, embrace variation in effects and recognize that we can learn much (indeed, more) about the world by forsaking the false promise of certainty offered by such dichotomization 
- recommendation for how to use p values
- as highly inter-disciplinary research team (statistics, political science, psychology and consumer behavior) implementation of their broad recommendations will vary vary tremendously across and even within domains.
- they cannot provide concrete and specific guidance on the application of the recommendation across all domains. Such a template might in fact be dangerous as it might lead to recipe like application of recommendation that would not be entirely dissimilar to, even if perhaps less harmful than, the curren tpractice of rote and recipe-like application of NHST.


### Recommendations for authors 

- include section to describe currently subordinate factors to motivate their data collection, statistical analysis, interpretation of results rather than focussing on single comparisons that attain some p-value or other statistical threshold

### For Editors and Reviewers 

- evaluate papers with regard not only purely statistical measures but also the currently subordinate factors
- e.g. editors could require reviewers to provide qunatitative evaluations of each factor - including domain-specific factors determined by the editor



 




 


### Design analysis 

1. Consider true effect size D
2. Treat it as random variable with SE
3. Estimate power, type S and type M error 


Note:

1. ...
 - The effec that would be observed in a very large sample
 - based on EXTERNAL information (other available data, literature review, or educated guess of a range of effect sizes)
 
 2. SE based on own dataset if retrospect design analysis 


+++

### Methods 2

- &rarr; relative microbiota maturity
- &rarr; microbiota-for-age Z score
- study the effects of environmental factors on these indeces (genetics, diarrheal episodes, antibiotics, infants formula)

Note:
- rel mb age = microbiota age - microbiota age of healthy child of similar age
- MAZ = (mb age - median mb age healthy children)/ median sd mb age healthy children same age

+++

### Results 2

- MAZ significantly decreased during 1 month after diarrheal episodes but not beyond that
- no effect of antibiotics
- infant formula associated with increased MAZ
- twins or triplets not more correlated than unrelated infants 


+++

### Methods & Results 3

@img[](assets/img/sub_intervention_a.png) 


Note: 
- Ready to use therapeutic food (peanut based)
- local lower-cost nutritional food rice-and-lentil- based therapeutic foods
-WHZ improved in both groups, not different between groups and remained below normal values throughout intervention and follow up period
children also remained below normal height and stayed severely underweight

+++

### Conclusion  

- Microbiota maturity indeces:
  - microbial measure of postnatal development 
  - lower in malnourished states
  - potential biomarker 
- what are age discriminatory taxa in other populations?

Note:
- germ free + manipulation strategies 
- early life cirtical periods of cross talk between gut&brain



To that extent, we describe microbial contributions to four phenomena of interest to cognitive scientists and psychologists, including (i) stress and emotion, (ii) learning and memory, (iii) social behavior, and (iv) autism.


Animal example:
- manipulation: probiotic/prebiotic/antibiotic + testing such as maze (e.g. Morris water maze) and/or inspection of brain tissue
- impairments in tests of memory and reductions in hippocampal BDNF in germ-free mice compared to normally colonized mice [74].
- rats administered ampicillin showed decreased spatial learning performance (and heightened anxiety) [75].
- compared to vehicle-treated rodents, mice and rats exposed to human milk oligosaccharides showed enhanced performance on a range of learning and memory tests, including working memory, spatial learning and memory, and learning via reinforcement [76].
- Investigations on infant rats showed similar effects of human milk oligosaccharides on novel object recognition, place and spatial memory, and long-term potentiation, benefits that were visible even 1 year after initial exposure to the prebiotic [77].



The hippocampus plays a crucial role in learning and memory, and its function in the generation and maintenance of spatial maps is especially well described in rodents [82].

## Human Study
@img[](assets/img/bio_psy.png)
@snapend

Note:

- n = 89 (69)
- limitation: one sample
- alpha neg associated with ELC score 

Carlson:
- n = 89 infants, 86 for Mullen 1 year and 69 Mullen two year
- Mullen: 5 scales: gross motor, fine motor, visual reception, expressive language, receptive language. except the gross motor skill combined to Early learning composite score
- MB at 1 year age
- Mullen Scales of Early Learning + global and regional brain volumes using structural MRI at 1 + 2 years of age
- cluster analysis identified 3 groups
- Mullen scores at 2 years differed between clusters: C2 (high in Bacteroides) highest performance in 90th percentile, C1 (high levels of Faecalibacterium) lowest (72th percentile)
- higher alhpa diversity ;rarr& lower overall composite score at age 2
- minimal association between the gut microbiota and brain volume
- negative association between AD and ELC (5-23% variance explained) depending on index

Note on Mullen:
The Mullen has good standardization and reliability data, with median internal consistency scores ranging between 0.75 and 0.91, and test-retest correlations over 0.82 for 1-25 months

Note:

Species richness (OTU count)  "How many?"
How many different species could be detected in a microbial ecosystem?
Species richness is the number of different species in a sample. 
Practically, we count the number of distinguishable taxa (OTU's) in each sample   → QIIME OTU counts

Species diversity (Shannon index)  "How different?"
How are the microbes balanced to each other? Do we have species evenness (similar abundance level) or do some species dominate others?
Shannon index measures how evenly the microbes are distributed in a sample.

## Statistical Analysis

- Extremely randomized trees
- K-means clustering
- Bayesian LM

Note:

EF:
- Tree ensemble method like random forest algorithm but:
  - uses whole training sample (reducing bias)
  - splitting the nodes with completely random cutoff points (reducing the variance)
  
- machine learning method for classification and regression
- robust to irrelevant variables, computational efficient, appropriate for high dimensional data, able to predict non-linear relationships




- EF: 
  1. Random 50/50 split
  2. Fit model
  3. predict scores from test set
  4. calculate Pearson 
  5. repeat 1000x

- Kmeans:Prediction Strength + Silhouette index

## Extremely Randomized Trees




Note:
(r(50) = .24, p = .036) 75 days 
(r(51) = .21, p = .034) 6 years 


+++


## Clustering



@img[span-55 revealborder](assets/img/clusterplot.png)




Note:
- no clustering in samples of first year
- clustering in the samples of 6 years
- no differences between cluster in cognitive outcome
- exploring subscales we found a difference in behavior regulation ($\mu_{2} - \mu_{1} = -3.45, \; 95\% \; CI \; [-6.56, \; -0.24]$)
- Behavior regulation at 8 years ($\mu_{2} - \mu_{1} = -3.19, \; 95\% \; CI \; [-6.40, \; 0.21]$)
- higher alpha diversity in cluster 2
- Cluster 1 is characterized by high relative abundance of bacteria belonging to Phylum Clostridium Cluster XIVa whereas cluster 2 is high in abundance of bacteria belonging to Bacteroidetes.
